# Snake Game in Assembly

Welcome to our Snake Game project, a classic arcade game reimagined in Assembly language. This project demonstrates a simplified version of the Snake game, designed to run on a NiosII processor. We have utilized a Gecko4Education board and Quartus software for development and testing.

## Project Overview

The primary aim of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of Assembly language programming by implementing a well-known game. The Snake game runs on a NiosII processor and is tested using Gecko4Education. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the process of running the Snake game on the Gecko4EPFL board.

1. **Setup NiosII CPU**: Utilize the NiosII CPU provided in the Quartus project `quartus/GECKO.qpf`.
2. **Compile the Quartus Project**: Follow the standard compilation process in Quartus to build the project.
3. **Program the FPGA**: Load the compiled program onto the FPGA on the Gecko4EPFL board.

For detailed guidance, including steps you're not familiar with, consult the provided `.pdf` document.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and environments set up to adjust, test, and run the project:

- **nios2sim Simulator (Java 10)**: For simulating the NiosII processor.
- **Gecko4Education**: The board used for testing the game.
- **Multicycle Nios II Processor**: The processor on which the game will run.
- **Quartus**: Software required for running and compiling the project.

## Built With

- **Quartus**: The primary software used for compiling and running the project.
- **NiosII**: The simulator for NiosII. The `niosII.jar` file can be used directly for this purpose.
